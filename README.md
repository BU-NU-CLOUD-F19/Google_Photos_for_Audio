## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project
Google Photos for Audio/Video will establish a website similar to “Google Photo”. On a high level, users can come to the site to upload their media files; the audio in these files will then be transcribed, allowing users to search for media using words found in their audio/video content.
High-level goals including:
Building a user-friendly website that allows users to upload/download and use specific keywords to search for audios/videos.
Utilizing AWS services like AWS S3, Lambda, Transcribe Service, DynamoDB, Comprehend for cloud platform, storage, audio/video-to-text translation, text analysis, etc. functions.
