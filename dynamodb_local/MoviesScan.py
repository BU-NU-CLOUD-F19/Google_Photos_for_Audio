# can't use it directly in any expression, including KeyConditionExpression.
# You can use the expression attribute name #yr to address this.
# ExpressionAttributeValues provides value substitution.
# You use this because you can't use literals in any expression,
# including KeyConditionExpression.
# You can use the expression attribute value :yyyy to address this.
